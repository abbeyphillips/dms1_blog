  <h2 style="font-size:40px; text-align:left;"> 1a: Intro to Creative Coding </h2>
  <br>
  <p style="font-family: 'Helvetica'; font-size:20px; text-align:left;"> Initially I struggled to make a grid until I looked through the resources on p5.js help and I found a tutorial titled ‘Create a grid of 10 columns and 5 rows by Tiri’. 

  <br><br>

  Rafaël Rozendaal's piece pinkyellowblue.com is composed of two coloured shapes slowly moving around the background that alternate colours when the circle and the square conflict with each other. Rewriting the code would require the background, circle and square, three colours, modify the positions, implement two colour changes, and then create a loop.

  <h2 style="font-size:40px; text-align:left;"> 1b: What is Creative Coding? </h2>
   <br>
  <p style="font-family: 'Helvetica'; font-size:20px; text-align:left;"> I created the background, circle and square with the corresponding colours on the p5 online editor. The tools and resources used were; a colour finder to identify the exact colours and the p5 reference library to locate the code necessary to make the shapes. </p>

  <h2 style="font-size:40px; text-align:left;"> 2a: Cute as Aesthetic Register </h2>
  <br>
  <p style="font-family: 'Helvetica'; font-size:20px; text-align:left;"> Visuals that I associate with cute are often light or pastel ombre in colour with smooth edges and a welcoming, childlike quality devoid of any hostility or pessimism. I find high pitched, melodic, energetic sounds to be the cutest, but I would say slow-paced, soothing songs are the cutest music. Cute interactions could involve a mouseClicked function that reveals some colourful shapes or change the colour of certain aspects of a sketch. 
  <br><br>
  Presently, I want to create a piece with multiple groups of shapes all fit together following a theme with one complex element such as a moving shape or colour change. My skillset is not as advanced, and I don’t want to plan an elaborate portrait without the proficiency required to follow it through. </p>
  <br><br>
  <h2 style="font-size:40px; text-align:left;"> 2b: Kindred Spirits (& more javascript!) </h2>
   <br>
  <p style="font-family: 'Helvetica'; font-size:20px; text-align:left;"> My kindred spirit is one of my close friends, Elise, who I met in ?2004? on the first day of kindergarten when we wore exactly the same dress. We’ve been friends ever since and she constantly inspires me through her determination, work ethic and inability to give anything less than 100% of her effort. Our common purpose would be supporting each other, feeling excited about the other person’s successes and providing comfort when necessary. Our shared adversary would be time, as our conflicting schedules prevent us from seeing each other as much as we would like. 
  <br><br>
  I’m aiming to create a sketch based on our childhood together, when we would see each other almost every day. I’ve changed my mind about the concept for my sketch and I want to create something based on the Nintendo DS ‘PictoChat’, which was a game that allowed users to sketch while chatting. Elise and I used to spend hours playing on it together after school, which could be replicated with a cute background and audio reminiscent of Nintendo DS games. </p>

  <h2 style="font-size:40px; text-align:left;"> 3a: Images, Sound, & Interaction ‘Landscapes’ by Rafaël Rozendaal is cute because of the colour gradients, which change when you click on the screen. Admittedly, I find some of the landscapes are less cute due to the dark colours, but I enjoy the premise of being able to change the colours to suit your own personal taste. This reminds me of using those sticky contact book covers that I used in primary school to personalise my notebooks. I think nostalgia can make anything cute. 
<br><br>
  Inspired by Rafaël Rozendaal’s piece, I created this pastel-coloured linear gradient background with two circles circulating around each other like time on a clock, which is supposed to symbolise my kindred spirit and I. This is visually cute, but I spent so much time trying to get the circles to move that I forgot to incorporate an interactive or sonic element.
